# Computer Vision
Courseworks and Project for computer vision.

## Binary Image Processing

The objective of this project is to gain experience with connected components analysis, morphological filters and the use of features computed within it for recognition of objects. A secondary objective is to gain experience with image formats. 

### Requirements

The student is to implement and/or modify a connected components program so that it will report on all objects found in a gray-level input image. The figure below shows an image of two overlapping playing cards. The program should be able to detect all 11 objects. Moreover, the features reported should indicate which objects are similar to others.

### Library
Pandas: use dataframe to store each object's features

OpenCV: process image

## Image Enhancement and Edge Detection

The first objective of the assignment is to implement image enhancement techniques. After enhancing the image, your solution must provide a selection of edge detectors to extract the contours of the image.

In this assignment, I have implemented a simple GUI for user adjusting different techniques to get the best result they needed.

### Libraries
OpenCV, numpy, pillow, matplotlib, tkinter
